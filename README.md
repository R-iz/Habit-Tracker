## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, building and maintaining positive habits is crucial for personal development and well-being. Traditional habit tracking methods often lack the convenience and analytical insights needed for long-term success. This project addresses these challenges by developing a modern, feature-rich Progressive Web Application that combines the accessibility of web technologies with the functionality of native mobile applications.

The Habit Tracker PWA is designed with a privacy-first approach, storing all user data locally using IndexedDB, eliminating the need for user accounts or data transmission to external servers. The application provides comprehensive habit management capabilities, including creation, tracking, analytics, and motivational features such as streak counting and achievement systems.
